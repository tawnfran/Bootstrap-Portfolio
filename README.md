# Bootstrap-Portfolio

"In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout"
This is the first portion of the assignment, using the Bootstrap Framework.

I updated my initial assignment of a basic portfolio page, using Bootstrap CSS Framework.
